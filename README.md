# SpyEngine
SpyEngine is an advanced Unreal sub editor module for researching PAK files

# What is SpyEngine
It is a UE Editor plugin module for browsing and loading external asset packages (e.g., UAssets from PAKs or folders). It provides a custom content browser UI (Slate-based) for exploring dependencies, thumbnails, and asset data without mounting the full project. It's designed for "spying" on assets (per SpyEngine's theme), with support for uncooked UAssets via a custom archive reader.
SpyEngine is not a data mining tool but an advanced UE Editor utility tool which can have Internal Sub modules for specific tasks.... Currently it supports to Explore Pak files from `OasisEditor(UGC)` and reconstruct any asset within editor without effecting the mounted pak file, and it also supports directly mounting a folder of !Cooked UAsset files currently from all games built with UE
